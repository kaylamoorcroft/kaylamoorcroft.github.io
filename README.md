# Why I am making this website
I have skills and experience in frontend web development but I don't have any projects that I can showcase to demonstrate this. 
This website is both a way for me to practice more web development skills as well as build a personal portfolio.  

I have listed some of my projects on places such as linkedin, but that's not how I want to present them necessarily.
This would be one place that contains work that I either enjoyed doing or am proud of. 
Not just for prospective employers but also as a hub for me to look back on the things I have done.
